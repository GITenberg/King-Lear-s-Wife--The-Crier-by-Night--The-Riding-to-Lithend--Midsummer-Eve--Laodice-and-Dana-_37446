<div class='cap'><div class='poem'>
<i>THE years come on, the years go by,<br />
And in my Northern valley I,<br />
Withdrawn from life, watch life go by.<br />
But I have formed within my heart<br />
A state that does not thus depart,<br />
Richer than life, greater than being,<br />
Truer in feeling and in seeing<br />
Than outward turbulence can know;<br />
Where time is still, like a large, slow<br />
And lofty bird that moves her wings<br />
In far, invisible flutterings<br />
To gaze on every part of space<br />
Yet poise for ever in one place;<br />
Where line and sound, colour and phrase<br />
Rebuild in clear, essential ways<br />
The powers behind the veil of sense;<br />
While tragic things are made intense<br />
By passion brooding on old dread,<br />
Till a faint light of beauty shed<br />
From night-enfolded agony<br />
Shews in the ways men fail and die<br />
The deeps whose knowledge never cloys<br />
But, striking inward without voice,<br />
Stirs me to tremble and rejoice.</i><br />
<br />
<i>For twenty years and more than twenty<br />
I have found my riches and my plenty<br />
In poets dead and poets living,<br />
Painters and music-men, all giving,<br />
By life shut in creative deeds,<br />
Live force and insight to my needs;<br />
And long before I came to stand<br />
And hear your voice and touch your hand<br />
In that great treasure-house new-known,<br />
Where in their tower above the Town<br />
The masters of </i>The Dial<i> sit,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>I loved in every word of it<br />
Your finely tempered verse that told me<br />
Of patient power, and still can hold me<br />
By its authentic divination<br />
Of the right knowledge of creation,<br />
Its grave, still beauty brought to day<br />
Tissue by tissue in nature's way,<br />
Petal by petal sure to shew<br />
Imagination's quiet glow<br />
That burns intenseliest at the core.<br />
And through that twenty years and more<br />
I have been envious of your reach<br />
In speaking form and plastic speech,<br />
Your double energy of hand<br />
That puts two arts at your command<br />
While I must be content with one<br />
And feel true life but half begun;<br />
So that by graver as by pen<br />
You can create earth, stars, and men,<br />
And prove yourself by more than rime<br />
A prince of poets in our time.</i><br />
<br />
<i>For these delights, and the delight<br />
Of converse in a Surrey night<br />
After the deep sound had lapsed by<br />
Of ocean-haunted poetry,<br />
For counsel and another zest<br />
Added to beauty's life-long quest<br />
I, in acknowledgment, would bring<br />
The homage of an offering;<br />
And, being too poor to reach the height<br />
Of my conception or requite<br />
Your greater giving equally,<br />
I search in my capacity<br />
And, by my self-appointed trade,<br />
Find something I myself have made,<br />
That here I offer. Let it be<br />
A token betwixt you and me<br />
Of admiration and loyalty.</i><br />

<h2>KING LEAR'S WIFE</h2>


<div class="hang1"><i>The scene is a bedchamber in a one-storied house.
The walls consist of a few courses of huge irregular
boulders roughly squared and fitted
together; a thatched roof rises steeply from the
back wall. In the centre of the back wall is a
doorway opening on a garden and covered by
two leather curtains; the chamber is partially
hung with similar hangings stitched with
bright wools. There is a small window on each
side of this door.</i>

<p><i>Toward the front a bed stands with its head
against the right wall; it has thin leather
curtains hung by thongs and drawn back.
Farther forward a rich robe and a crown hang
on a peg in the same wall. There is a second
door beyond the bed, and between this and the
bed's head stands a small table with a bronze
lamp and a bronze cup on it. Queen <span class="smcap">Hygd</span>,
an emaciated woman, is asleep in the bed; her
plenteous black hair, veined with silver, spreads
over the pillow. Her waiting-woman, <span class="smcap">Merryn</span>,
middle-aged and hard-featured, sits watching
her in a chair on the farther side of the bed.
The light of early morning fills the room.</i></p></div>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Merryn</span>.<br />
<div class='cap'>MANY, many must die who long to live,<br />
Yet this one cannot die who longs to die:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Even her sleep, come now at last, thwarts death,<br />
Although sleep lures us all half way to death....<br />
I could not sit beside her every night<br />
If I believed that I might suffer so:<br />
I am sure I am not made to be diseased,<br />
I feel there is no malady can touch me&mdash;<br />
Save the red cancer, growing where it will.<br />
</div></div>

<div class='sdirection'><i>Taking her beads from her girdle, she
kneels at the foot of the bed.</i></div>

<div class='poem'>
O sweet Saint Cleer, and sweet Saint Elid too,<br />
Shield me from rooting cancers and from madness:<br />
Shield me from sudden death, worse than two death-beds;<br />
Let me not lie like this unwanted queen,<br />
Yet let my time come not ere I am ready&mdash;<br />
Grant space enow to relish the watchers' tears<br />
And give my clothes away and calm my features<br />
And streek my limbs according to my will,<br />
Not the hard will of fumbling corpse-washers.<br />
</div>

<div class='sdirection'><i>She prays silently.</i></div>

<div class='sdirection'><i><span class="smcap">King Lear</span>, a great, golden-bearded man

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
Why are you here? Are you here for ever?<br />
Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is she?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Merryn.</span><br />
O, Sire, move softly; the Queen sleeps at last.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear</span>, <i>continuing in an undertone.</i><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is Gormflaith?<br />
It is her watch.... I know; I have marked your hours.<br />
Did the Queen send her away? Did the Queen<br />
Bid you stay near her in her hate of Gormflaith?<br />
You work upon her yeasting brain to think<br />
That she's not safe except when you crouch near her<br />
To spy with your dropt eyes and soundless presence.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Merryn.</span><br />
Sire, midnight should have ended Gormflaith's watch,<br />
But Gormflaith had another kind of will<br />
And ended at a godlier hour by slumber,<br />
A letter in her hand, the night-lamp out.<br />
She loitered in the hall when she should sleep.<br />
My duty has two hours ere she returns.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
The Queen should have young women about her bed,<br />
Fresh cool-breathed women to lie down at her side<br />
And plenish her with vigour; for sick or wasted women<br />
Can draw a virtue from such abounding presence,<br />
When night makes life unwary and looses the strings of being,<br />
Even by the breath, and most of all by sleep.<br />
Her slumber was then no fault: go you and find her.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Physician.</span><br />
It is not strange that a bought watcher drowses;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>What is most strange is that the Queen sleeps<br />
Who would not sleep for all my draughts of sleep<br />
In the last days. When did this change appear?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Merryn.</span><br />
We shall not know&mdash;it came while Gormflaith nodded.<br />
When I awoke her and she saw the Queen<br />
She could not speak for fear:<br />
When the rekindling lamp showed certainly<br />
The bed-clothes stirring about our lady's neck,<br />
She knew there was no death, she breathed, she said<br />
She had not slept until her mistress slept<br />
And lulled her; but I asked her how her mistress<br />
Slept, and her utterance faded.<br />
She should be blamed with rods, as I was blamed<br />
For slumber, after a day and a night of watching,<br />
By the Queen's child-bed, twenty years ago.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
She does what she must do: let her alone.<br />
I know her watch is now: get gone and send her.<br />
</div>

<div class='sdirection'><i><span class="smcap">Merryn</span> goes out by the door beyond the bed.</i></div>

<div class='poem'>
Is it a portent now to sleep at night?<br />
What change is here? What see you in the Queen?<br />
Can you discern how this disease will end?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Physician.</span><br />
Surmise might spring and healing follow yet,<br />
If I could find a trouble that could heal;<br />
But these strong inward pains that keep her ebbing<br />
Have not their source in perishing flesh.<br />
I have seen women creep into their beds<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>And sink with this blind pain because they nursed<br />
Some bitterness or burden in the mind<br />
That drew the life, sucklings too long at breast.<br />
Do you know such a cause in this poor lady?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
There is no cause. How should there be a cause?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Physician.</span><br />
We cannot die wholly against our wills;<br />
And in the texture of women I have found<br />
Harder determination than in men:<br />
The body grows impatient of enduring,<br />
The harried mind is from <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> body estranged,<br />
And we consent to go: by the Queen's touch,<br />
The way she moves&mdash;or does not move&mdash;in bed,<br />
The eyes so cold and keen in her white mask,<br />
I know she has consented.<br />
The snarling look of a mute wounded hawk,<br />
That would be let alone, is always hers&mdash;<br />
Yet she was sorely tender: it may be<br />
Some wound in her affection will not heal.<br />
We should be careful&mdash;the mind can so be hurt<br />
That nought can make it be unhurt again.<br />
Where, then, did her affection most persist?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
Old bone-patcher, old digger in men's flesh,<br />
Doctors are ever itching to be priests,<br />
Meddling in conduct, natures, life's privacies.<br />
We have been coupled now for twenty years,<br />
And she has never turned from me an hour&mdash;<br />
She knows a woman's duty and a queen's:<br />
Whose, then, can her affection be but mine?<br />
How can I hurt her&mdash;she is still my queen?<br />
If her strong inward pain is a real pain<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Find me some certain drug to medicine it:<br />
When common beings have decayed past help,<br />
There must be still some drug for a king to use;<br />
For nothing ought to be denied to kings.<br />
<br />

For the mere anguish there is such a potion.<br />
The gum of warpy juniper shoots is seethed<br />
With the torn marrow of an adder's spine;<br />
An unflawed emerald is pashed to dust<br />
And mingled there; that broth must cool in moonlight.<br />
I have indeed attempted this already,<br />
But the poor emeralds I could extort<br />
From wry-mouthed earls' women had no force.<br />
In two more dawns it will be late for potions....<br />
There are not many emeralds in Britain,<br />
And there is none for vividness and strength<br />

I dreamt that I was swimming, shoulder up,<br />
And drave the bed-clothes spreading to the floor:<br />
Coldness awoke me; through the waning darkness<br />
I heard far hounds give shivering a&euml;ry tongue,<br />
Remote, withdrawing, suddenly faint and near;<br />
I leapt and saw a pack of stretching weasels<br />
Hunt a pale coney in a soundless rush,<br />
Their elfin and thin yelping pierced my heart<br />
As with an unseen beauty long awaited;<br />
Wolf-skin and cloak I buckled over this night-gear,<br />
And took my honoured spear from my bed-side<br />
Where none but I may touch its purity,<br />
And sped as lightly down the dewy bank<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>As any mothy owl that hunts quick mice.<br />
They went crying, crying, but I lost them<br />
Before I stept, with the first tips of light,<br />
On Raven Crag near by the Druid Stones;<br />
So I paused there and, stooping, pressed my hand<br />
Against the stony bed of the clear stream;<br />
Then entered I the circle and raised up<br />
My shining hand in cold stern adoration<br />
Even as the first great gleam went up the sky.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hygd.</span><br />
Ay, you do well to worship on that height:<br />
Life is free to the quick up in the wind,<br />
And the wind bares you for a god's descent&mdash;<br />
For wind is a spirit immediate and aged.<br />
And you do well to worship harsh men-gods,<br />
God Wind and Those who built his Stones with him:<br />
All gods are cruel, bitter, and to be bribed,<br />
But women-gods are mean and cunning as well.<br />
That fierce old virgin, Cornish Merryn, prays<br />
To a young woman, yes and even a virgin&mdash;<br />
The poorest kind of woman&mdash;and she says<br />
That is to be a Christian: avoid then<br />
Her worship most, for men hate such denials,<br />
And any woman scorns her unwed daughter.<br />
Where sped you from that height? Did Regan join you there?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goneril.</span><br />
Does Regan worship anywhere at dawn?<br />
The sweaty half-clad cook-maids render lard<br />
Out in the scullery, after pig-killing,<br />

Smeary and hot as they, for craps to suck.<br />

And when anew the earth assembled round me<br />
I swung out on the heath and woke a hare<br />
And speared it at a cast and shouldered it,<br />
Startled another drinking at a tarn<br />
And speared it ere it leapt; so steady and clear<br />
Had the god in his fastness made my mind.<br />
Then, as I took those dead things in my hands,<br />
I felt shame light my face from deep within,<br />
And loathing and contempt shake in my bowels,<br />
That such unclean coarse blows from me had issued<br />
To crush delicate things to bloody mash<br />
And blemish their fur when I would only kill.<br />
My gladness left me; I careered no more<br />
Upon the morning; I went down from there<br />
With empty hands:<br />
But under the first trees and without thought<br />
I stole on conies at play and stooped at one;<br />
I hunted it, I caught it up to me<br />
As I outsprang it, and with this thin knife<br />
Pierced it from eye to eye; and it was dead,<br />
Untorn, unsullied, and with flawless fur.<br />
Then my untroubled mind came back to me.<br />
<br />

She must give herself for ever and have faith;<br />
For woman is a thing of a season of years,<br />
She is an early fruit that will not keep,<br />
She can be drained and as a husk survive<br />
To hope for reverence for what has been;<br />
While man renews himself into old age,<br />

May take him yet with youth<br />

And yet your daughter Princess Goneril has said<br />
(With lips that scarce held back the spittle for my face)<br />
That if the Queen is left again I shall be whipt.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Lear.</span><br />
Children speak of the punishments they know.<br />
Her back is now not half so white as yours,<br />
And you shall write your will upon it yet.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Ah, no, my King, my faithful... Ah, no... no...<br />
The Princess Goneril is right; she judges me:<br />
A sinful woman cannot steadily gaze reply<br />
To the cool, baffling looks of virgin untried force.<br />
She stands beside that crumbling mother in her hate,<br />
And, though we know so well&mdash;she and I, O we know&mdash;<br />
That she could love no mother nor partake in anguish,<br />
Yet she is flouted when the King forsakes her dam,<br />
She must protect her very flesh, her tenderer flesh,<br />
Although she cannot wince; she's wild in her cold brain,<br />
And soon I must be made to pay a cruel price<br />
For this one gloomy joy in my uncherished life.<br />
Envy and greed are watching me aloof<br />
(Yes, now none of the women will walk with me),<br />
Longing to see me ruined, but she'll do it....<br />
It is a lonely thing to love a king....<br />

<div class='sdirection'><i>She puts her cheek gradually closer and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>A tawny fox with your high-stepping action,<br />

Hatch for me such a youngster from my seed,<br />

<span class="smcap">Gormflaith</span>, <i>shaking her head sadly.</i><br />
Life holds no more than this for me; this is my hour.<br />
When she is dead I know you'll buy another Queen&mdash;<br />
Giving a county for her, gaining a duchy with her&mdash;<br />
And put me to wet nursing, leashing me with the thralls.<br />
It will not be unbearable&mdash;I've had your love.<br />
Master and friend, grant then this hour to me:<br />
Never again, maybe, can we two sit<br />
At love together, unwatched, unknown of all,<br />
In the Queen's chamber, near the Queen's crown<br />
And with no conscious Queen to hold it from us:<br />
Now let me wear the Queen's true crown on me<br />
And snatch a breathless knowledge of the feeling<br />
Of what it would have been to sit by you<br />
Always and closely, equal and exalted,<br />
To be my light when life is dark again.<br />

Girl, by the black stone god, I did not think<br />
You had the nature of a chambermaid,<br />

<h2>THE CRIER BY NIGHT</h2>


<div class='hang1'><i>The scene is the interior of a cottage near a misty
mere and among unseen mountains on a wild
night of late Autumn. In the back wall area
door to the left and a long low window in the
middle; the latter is shuttered on the outside,
and on door and window the wind-driven rain
rattles. In the middle of the left-hand wall a
door leads into an outhouse; near it is a loom:
toward the front of the right-hand wall another
door leads to a sleeping-chamber; a settle extends
along this wall and in front of it a long
table is set. Two rushlights burn on the
table. A round hearth is in the middle of the
house; its smoke rises into a luffer which
hangs from the thatched roof between two
beams. The floor is thickly strewn with rushes.
There are several wooden stools about the
hearth, on one of which <span class="smcap">Hialti</span> is sitting mending
harness. <span class="smcap">Thorgerd</span> is standing near the
loom, spinning with a distaff.</i><br /><br /></div>

My father gave her to me for my own,<br />
And so I use her as I use my gear....<br />
"She will not last" say you? Well, what of that?<br />
I know gear must wear out, being well used;<br />
Shoes must be trodden under-foot all day,<br />
Though in the mire they go and to the mire;<br />
The hearth-fire wastes the irons used to tend it:<br />
I am the huswife&mdash;leave the house to me<br />
And buy me new gear when the old is rotten.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hialti.</span><br />
You drive her over hard. In the cold dark,<br />
Hours ere the thin late dawn, she was afoot,<br />
And she has been afoot each moment since:<br />
The butter will not come now without fire,<br />
But I was wakened in the frosty night<br />
By the slow moaning of her weary churn,<br />
And when I rose she stood here without shoes&mdash;<br />
She said you took them from her; so I sought,<br />
And gave her them again, and lit the fire.<br />
She dare not sleep with half your tasks undone,<br />
But you slept and your sleep was all her rest;<br />
Yet in her land 'tis you would be the thrall.<br />
You shut the hens in from the storm all day,<br />
But she must trudge with peat-mull in a swill<br />
Up from the water-side and down all day....<br />

It shall not be so long; sing while you can.<br />

I am made glad, hearing your misery;<br />
Yet all the shapeless, creeping, shivering sounds<br />

And things that never happened long ago<br />

<i>HERE in the North we speak of you,<br />
And dream (and wish the dream were true)<br />
That when the evening has grown late<br />
You will appear outside our gate&mdash;<br />
As though some Gipsy-Scholar yet<br />
Sought this far place that men forget;<br />
Or some tall hero still unknown,<br />
Out of the Mabinogion,<br />
Were seen at nightfall looking in,<br />
Passing mysteriously to win<br />
His earlier earth, his ancient mind,<br />
Where man was true and life more kind<br />
Lived with the mountains and the trees<br />
And other steadfast presences,<br />
Where large and simple passions gave<br />
The insight and the peace we crave,<br />
And he no more had nigh forgot<br />
The old high battles he had fought.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Ah, pause to-night outside our gate<br />
And enter ere it is too late<br />
To see the garden's deep on deep<br />
And talk a little ere we sleep.</i><br />
<br />
<i>When you were here a year ago<br />
I told you of a glorious woe,<br />
The ancient woe of Gunnar dead<br />
And its proud train of men long sped,<br />
Fit brothers to your noble thoughts;<br />
Then, as their shouts and Gunnar's shouts<br />
Went down once more undyingly<br />
And the fierce saga was put by,<br />
I told you of my old desire<br />
To light again that bygone fire,<br />
To body Hallgerd's ruinous<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Great hair and wrangling mouth for us,<br />
And hear her voice deny again<br />
That hair to Gunnar in his pain.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Because your heart could understand<br />
The hopes of their primeval land,<br />
The hearts of dim heroic forms<br />
Made clear by tenderness and storms,<br />
You caught my glow and urged me on;<br />
So now the tale is once more done<br />
I turn to you, I bring my play,<br />
Longing, O friend, to hear you say<br />
I have not dwarfed those olden things<br />
Nor tarnisht by my furbishings.</i><br />
<br />
<i>I bring my play, I turn to you<br />
And wish it might to-night be true<br />

To you, and with my play my hand.</i><br />

<h2>THE RIDING TO LITHEND</h2>


<div class='hang1'><i>The scene is the hall of Gunnar's house at Lithend
in South Iceland. The portion shewn is set on
the stage diagonally, so that to the right one
end is seen while, from the rear corner of this,
one side runs down almost to the left front.</i>

<p><i>The side wall is low and wainscotted with
carved panelling on which hang weapons,
shields, and coats of mail. In one place a panel
slid aside shews a shut bed.</i></p>

<p><i>In front of the panelling are two long benches
with a carved high-seat between them. Across
the end of the hall are similar panellings and
the seats, with corresponding tables, of the
women's da&iuml;s; behind these and in the gable
wall is a high narrow door with a rounded top.</i></p>

<p><i>A timber roof slopes down to the side wall
and is upheld by cross-beams and two rows of
tall pillars which make a rather narrow nave
of the centre of the hall. One of these rows runs
parallel to the side wall, the pair of pillars
before the high-seat being carved and ended
with images; of the other row only two pillars
are visible at the extreme right.</i></p>

<p><i>Within this nave is the space for the hearths;
but the only hearth visible is the one near the
women's da&iuml;s. In the roof above it there is a
louvre: the fire glows and no smoke rises. The
hall is lit everywhere by the firelight.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The rafters over the women's da&iuml;s carry a
floor at the level of the side walls, forming an
open loft which is reached by a wide ladder
fixed against the wall: a bed is seen in this
loft. Low in the roof at intervals are shuttered
casements, one being above the loft: all the
shutters are closed.</i></p>

<p><i>Near the fire a large shaggy hound is sleeping;
and <span class="smcap">Ormild</span>, in the undyed woollen dress
of a thrall, is combing wool.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Oddny</span> stands spinning at the far side; near
her <span class="smcap">Astrid</span> and <span class="smcap">Steinvor</span> sit stitching a robe
which hangs between them.</i></p></div>

NIGHT is a Winter long: and evening falls.<br />
Night, night and Winter and the heavy snow<br />
Burden our eyes, intrude upon our dreams,<br />
And make of loneliness an earthly place.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ormild</span>.<br />
This bragging land of freedom that enthralls me<br />

I like not dwelling in an outlaw's house.<br />

This void house is more void by brooding things<br />
That do not happen than by absent men.<br />

My throbbing ears are mocking me with rumours<br />

He is so great and manly, our master Gunnar,<br />

My son has enemies, girl, enemies,<br />

You are conversant with a widow's fancies....<br />
Ay, you are ready with your widowhood:<br />
Two men have had you, chilled their bosoms with you,<br />

Their lives for joy of seeing something done with.<br />
Cannot you wait this time? 'Twill not be long.<br />

A warm unsounded peril, a flashing mischief,<br />

Thus I was shapen, and it is my pride<br />
To nourish all the fires that mingled me.<br />
I am not long moved, I do not mar my face,<br />
Though men have sunk in me as in a quicksand.<br />
Well, death is terrible. Was I not worth it?<br />
Does not the light change on me as I breathe?<br />
Could I not take the hearts of generations,<br />
Walking among their dreams? O, I have might,<br />
Although it drives me too and is not my own deed....<br />
And Gunnar is great, or he had died long since.<br />
It is my joy that Gunnar stays with me:<br />
Indeed the offence is theirs who hunted him,<br />

Men to fight on forever because she lives:<br />

To nibble earth's lip away until the sea<br />
Poured down the darkness. Why then should I sail<br />

If you should choose to leave him. Is it not law?<br />
Is it not law that you could loose this marriage&mdash;<br />
Nay, that he loosed it shamefully years ago<br />
By a hard blow that bruised your innocent cheek,<br />
Dishonouring you to lesser women and chiefs?<br />
See, it burns up again at the stroke of thought.<br />
Come, leave him, mistress; we will go with you.<br />
There is no woman in the country now<br />
Whose name can kindle men as yours can do&mdash;<br />
Ay, many would pile for you the silks he grudges;<br />
And if you did withdraw your potent presence<br />

Am I a wandering flame that sears and passes?<br />
We must bide here, good Steinvor, and be quiet.<br />
Without a man a woman cannot rule,<br />
Nor kill without a knife; and where's the man<br />
That I shall put before this goodly Gunnar?<br />
I will not be made less by a less man.<br />
There is no man so great as my man Gunnar:<br />
I have set men at him to show forth his might;<br />
I have planned thefts and breakings of his word<br />
When my pent heart grew sore with fermentation<br />
Of malice too long undone, yet could not stir him.<br />
O, I will make a battle of the Thing,<br />
Where men vow holy peace, to magnify him.<br />
Is it not rare to sit and wait o' nights,<br />
Knowing that murderousness may even now<br />
Be coming down outside like second darkness<br />
Because my man is greater?<br />

That blow upon the face<br />
So long ago is best not spoken of.<br />
I drave a thrall to steal and burn at Otkell's<br />
Who would not sell to us in famine time<br />
But denied Gunnar as if he were suppliant:<br />
Then at our feast when men rode from the Thing<br />
I spread the stolen food and Gunnar knew.<br />
He smote me upon the face ... indeed he smote me....<br />
O, Gunnar smote me and had shame of me<br />
And said he'd not partake with any thief;<br />
Although I stole to injure his despiser....<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>But if he had abandoned me as well<br />
'Tis I who should have been unmated now;<br />

He kept you his&mdash;yes, and maybe saved you<br />
From a debasement that could madden or kill,<br />
For women thieves ere now have felt a knife<br />
Severing ear or nose. And yet the feud<br />
You sowed with Otkell's house shall murder Gunnar.<br />
Otkell was slain: then Gunnar's enviers,<br />
Who could not crush him under his own horse<br />
At the big horse-fight, stirred up Otkell's son<br />
To avenge his father; for should he be slain<br />
Two in one stock would prove old Njal's fore-telling,<br />
And Gunnar's place be emptied either way<br />
For those high helpless men who cannot fill it.<br />
O, mistress, you have hurt us all in this:<br />
You have cut off your strength, you have maimed yourself,<br />
You are losing power and worship and men's trust.<br />
When Gunnar dies no other man dare take you.<br />

From the East, from the East we drove and the wind waved us,<br />
Over the heaths, over the barren ashes.<br />
We are old, our eyes are old, and the light hurts us,<br />
We have skins on our eyes that part alone to the star-light.<br />
We stumble about the night, the rocks tremble<br />
Beneath our trembling feet; black sky thickens,<br />
Breaks into clots, and lets the moon upon us.<br />

<div class='poem'>
Far from the men who fear us, men who stone us,<br />
Hiding, hiding, flying whene'er they slumber,<br />
High on the crags we pause, over the moon-gulfs;<br />
Black clouds fall and leave us up in the moon-depths<br />
Where wind flaps our hair and cloaks like fin-webs,<br />
Ay, and our sleeves that toss with our arms and the cadence<br />
Of quavering crying among the threatening echoes.<br />
Then we spread our cloaks and leap down the rock-stairs,<br />
Sweeping the heaths with our skirts, greying the dew-bloom,<br />
Until we feel a pool on the wide dew stretches<br />
Stilled by the moon or ruffling like breast-feathers,<br />
And, with grey sleeves cheating the sleepy herons,<br />
Squat among them, pillow us there and sleep.<br />
But in the harder wastes we stand upright,<br />
Like splintered rain-worn boulders set to the wind<br />
In old confederacy, and rest and sleep.<br />

Succour upon this terrible journeying.<br />
We have a message for a man in the West,<br />

We are spent, our feet are moving wounds, our bodies<br />
Dream of themselves and seem to trail behind us<br />
Because we went unfed down in the mountains.<br />
Feed us and shelter us beneath your roof,<br />
And put us over the Markfleet, over the channels.<br />
We are weak old women: we are beseeching you.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Gunnar.</span><br />
You may bide here this night, but on the morrow<br />
You shall go over, for tramping shameless women<br />
Carry too many tales from stead to stead&mdash;<br />
And sometimes heavier gear than breath and lies.<br />
These women will tell the mistress all I grant you;<br />
Get to the fire until she shall return.<br />

What are these women, Oddny? Who let them in?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Biartey</span>, <i>who spins through all that follows.</i><br />
Lady, the man of fame who is your man<br />
Gave us his peace to-night, and that of his house.<br />
We are blown beggars tramping about the land,<br />
Denied a home for our evil and vagrant hearts;<br />
We sought this shelter when the first dew soaked us,<br />
And should have perished by the giant hound<br />
But Gunnar fought it with his eyes and saved us.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>That is a strange hound, with a man's mind in it.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hallgerd</span>, <i>seating herself in the high-seat.</i><br />
It is an Irish hound, from that strange soil<br />
Where men by day walk with unearthly eyes<br />
And cross the veils of the air, and are not men<br />
But fierce abstractions eating their own hearts<br />
Impatiently and seeing too much to be joyful....<br />
If Gunnar welcomed ye, ye may remain.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Biartey.</span><br />
She is a fair free lady, is she not?<br />
But that was to be looked for in a high one<br />
Who counts among her fathers the bright Sigurd,<br />
The bane of Fafnir the Worm, the end of the god-kings;<br />
Among her mothers Brynhild, the lass of Odin,<br />
The maddener of swords, the night-clouds' rider.<br />
She has kept sweet that father's lore of bird-speech,<br />
She wears that mother's power to cheat a god.<br />
Sisters, she does well to be proud....<br />

But if strife might be warmed by spreading it.<br />

O, they have hurt you ... but that is forgot.<br />
Boy, it is bedtime; though I am too changed,<br />

You shall go warm to bed&mdash;I'll put you there.<br />
There is no comfort in my breast to-night:<br />
But close your eyes beneath my fingers' touch,<br />

But some will waken.          <i>She rises.</i><br />
You had a rare toy when you were awake&mdash;<br />
I'll wipe it with my hair ... Nay, keep it so,<br />
The colour on it now has gladdened you.<br />
It shall lie near you.<br />
<i>She raises the bill: the deep hum follows.</i><br />

<i>TO CLINTON BALMER<br />
AND THE DEAR MEMORY OF<br />
JAMES HAMILTON HAY<br />
FOR THE SUMMER OF 1900<br />
AT CARTMEL</i><br /><br />
</div>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
<i>IN the lost Valley all is still<br />
To-day: upon the stony hill<br />
The heat of the late afternoon<br />
Settles in coppery haze: and soon<br />
A voice not known to me will call<br />
Silent obedient cows to stall,<br />
In the same immemorial cry<br />
From century to century<br />
Changing but by the uttering voice.<br />
And in a while a little noise<br />
(Hou! Hou!) far off near Newton Head<br />
Will tell that at another stead<br />
The browsing cattle pause and turn<br />
Unwilling heads to seem to learn<br />
That which they know, and move in train<br />
Now milking-time has come again.<br /></i></div>
<br />
<i>In Well Knowe garden now, I know,<br />
Where the pale larkspur used to grow<br />
In the far nook, a sound is heard<br />
(If any is there to hear save bird<br />
And field-mouse in the strawberries<br />
Stirring like a local breeze&mdash;<br />
Here, there&mdash;the low leaves soundlessly);<br />
A glistening slender wasp-like fly<br />
Is using will and wing to stand<br />
Upon the air as though it spanned<br />
A chasm with trembling outstretched arms,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>And in the silence of heat-stilled farms<br />
And heat-veiled wood that seems to shake<br />
Dim clotted leaves yet does not break<br />
By sigh or rustle the hush so dear<br />
Its tiny sting of sound sings clear.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Oft have I heard that elfin horn<br />
Sound suddenly, as cobweb torn<br />
Must sound in startled elfin ears<br />
Pricked and on edge with elfin fears;<br />
And as I upward watched those spare<br />
Twin shreds of silver like slit air,<br />
Beating and shining, straight and tense,<br />
Simulating impotence<br />
Of motion, enviously I thought<br />
"Had my half useless flesh been caught,<br />
Upborn, and for all limit bound<br />
Between such gossamers of sound,<br />
Not thus, not thus would I deny<br />
My spirit's reach and endlessly<br />
Use all conception and all force<br />
To limit my short vital course.<br />
Had I such wings of urgent light<br />
Insistent not alone on height<br />
But stretched for sweep and latitude<br />
I would not evade flight, I would<br />
Employ my heat and power and sense<br />
In realising difference,<br />
And see my world's variety,<br />
Restricted but by energy."</i><br />
<br />
<i>But Well Knowe garden only shines<br />
In memory now, and its dear signs<br />
Only persist and gleam again<br />
In a shut chamber of my brain:<br />
While in a distant place I brood<br />
Upon lost things, and in a mood<br />
Of longing and remembrance feel<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The wisdom of that immobile<br />
And senseless mote, and think "Were I<br />
Carnate in a slim glistening fly,<br />
I would flash back upon that fair<br />
Laurel-walled rood, then drop in air<br />
Till no translucent nerve should stir<br />
From strained precision, nor wing should whir<br />
But to maintain one changeless height,<br />
Nor move nor waver from that sight;<br />
And think the years have not gone by<br />
When James and Clinton harboured nigh<br />
And, working in another art<br />
Than mine, yet peopled for my heart<br />
The Valley with the very core<br />
Of vital beauty for evermore&mdash;<br />
So that when the air is still<br />
I hear below the meadow-rill<br />
Clinton singing softlier still<br />
Entranced by his own moving brush<br />
Among the stream-side bracken and rush&mdash;<br />
Or James repeats with his long hand<br />
The distant line of hills that stand<br />
Between the Valley and the lake<br />
And yet seem lovelier for his sake."</i><br />
<br />
<i>How many generations past<br />
Should I be dead had I been cast<br />
In that small rapid shape of light?<br />
Though wings may stand, years move in flight;<br />
And, while I dream, I know, I know<br />
That it is useless I should go<br />
To Well Knowe garden again to see<br />
Things that cannot return to me&mdash;<br />
James dead and Clinton gone away,<br />
And one whose name I cannot say<br />
Who built in Cyclopean sound<br />
Other magic heights around<br />
That little place, then turned apart,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Untrue to friendship and to art,<br />
A man of nothing&mdash;vanished things,<br />
Dead friends, dead hopes, that must remain<br />
In a shut chamber of my brain;<br />
While only Clinton far away<br />
Will in these verses and this play<br />
See that country of our youth<br />
And our dead friend and our old troth<br />
Of friendship fixed in amber light,<br />
A timeless hour that holds no night.</i><br />

<h2>MIDSUMMER EVE</h2>

<div class='hang1'><i>The scene is the interior of an old barn on a knoll,
a long time ago. At the back the barn's doors
are opened widely; outside, a road rises slightly
from left to right in front of the barn; beyond
this the knoll sinks softly yet swiftly to a great
meadow, and thence to a wide rich valley of
more meadows and ever more meadows with
ancient large cherry and crab and sloe and
bullace and damson trees in their hedges whence
the white and pink thorn-blossom clots are not
quite gone, and of pastures shaded by tall clustering
trees. Afar the valley ceases in low,
densely wooded hills.</i>

<p><i>A late June twilight is deepening; a faint
moist heat-haze hides nothing, only distinguishing
the planes of the distant trees with a
cloudy delicacy. There is no wind, nor any
movement; one blackbird sings somewhere for
a little while, then it ceases and there is no
sound in the fields.</i></p>

<p><i>The whole prospect is of a solitary, fruitfully
overgrown valley shut in from everywhere.</i></p>

<p><i>Within the barn, to the left, is a high hay-mow
with a ladder leaning against it; much
hay has been tumbled at its foot in forking from
the carts. To the right is a space of floor where
the corn is to be heaped in the ending of summer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as yet, however, it is empty, save for a wooden
plough, a homely rough wooden roller, wooden
harrows, an uptilted, pleasantly shaped cart
whence the hay-shelvings have not yet been
removed. In the far corner of the bare walls of
undressed stone at this side is an open door
leading into a mistal. Presently a cow is heard
moaning sickly beyond this door.</i></p>

<p><i>The barn is still more dim than the land, so
that a stretch of soft brown darkness is all that
is known of the far-off roof. Nearing footfalls
are heard in the road, and a woman's singing
grows clearer.</i></p></div>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"HOU, Hou," went the neatherd moaning<br />
Down along by the pasture's side;<br />
He turned the cows at the midden-yard loaning,<br />
The loitering cows in the brown owl-tide:<br />
Pale rose the last one, munching, droning,<br />
With wet grass stains on her udder and hide.<br /></div>
<br />
My lantern's rings to the low balks floated<br />
As Whitey's tail shook the mistal-sneck;<br />
When I laid my cheek to her belly spotted<br />
I felt her honey-strong breath i' my neck,<br />
For she turns her head does the curd-dark throated<br />
To watch my mouth start her teats with a peck.<br />

<div class='sdirection'><i><span class="smcap">Nan</span>, <span class="smcap">Bet</span> and <span class="smcap">Ursel</span> ascend the road to

<div class='sdirection'><i>They are white-hooded, clumsily shod,

September, O, September's in the song&mdash;<br />
I will not have September in my heart,<br />
The ending of so much deliciousness,<br />
The year's sad luscious over-ripening.<br />
Yet here's the haysel done with: how it hurt<br />
To rake behind the last dim cart; and now<br />
My soul creeps in me like the low pale night-mist<br />
To know that in a moment past this moment<br />
We shall not hear it slowly any more<br />
Down in the lane where, wisping the close trees,<br />
It follows us like a mournful sound of change.<br />
Although the Summer is but newly kindled,<br />
Tiptoe I over-reach the joy of it<br />
(Ah, little perfect weeks of fruitfulness)<br />
Because I tremble lest it be slipping past me<br />
Before my eagerness will let me feel it.<br />
Must joy for me be ever in things gone?...<br />
<br />
<div class='hang1'><span class="smcap">Nan</span>, <i>as they set down their burdens to lean
the rakes against the wall, where four flails are
hung, on the left of the door.</i></div>
Nay, there is comfort in the rainy nights,<br />
The long moist twilights of the cider time<br />
When girls hold fitful talk sat in the press-spot<br />
Among the hid sweet apple heaps that gleam<br />
In firelight to a humming out of doors<br />
Of soddening water oozing down the soil;<br />
And there is comfort too at Candlemas<br />
From looking through the casement in the dark,<br />
The last thing ere you chafe your toes in bed,<br />
On the crisp quiet of the woods and fields,<br />
Wondering if 'tis snow or all the moonlight,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Peering so anxiously along the wall<br />
That shades still ewes and whiter first-dropped lambs....<br />
Ay, but I'm tired, lasses, tired now<br />
Because the haysel's over and 'twas fair<br />
And the land's savour wears me with delight.<br />
I'm for indoors and resting&mdash;and, beside,<br />
I'm fainest of my supper o' baking days.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
Let all times slip to haste the barley week,<br />
For then our nearest dancing-time will ripen ...<br />
But I'm for bed to get me doffed and stripped<br />
To pick much grass seed from my smock and coats.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ursel.</span><br />
Listen, Bet; no cool sheets are yours to-night.<br />
The milk-eyed goodies with grey loose-skinned throats,<br />
Who maunder of rarer girlhoods none can prove,<br />
Tell that at midnight on Midsummer-Eves<br />
They waked in some lone shade far from all sleepers<br />
To feel which should be wedded within the year;<br />
For the year's unknown husbands' images<br />
Come then like swoons from some where ... ay, from some where....<br />
Thoughts shaping for their women's heedless souls,<br />
And if a maid will watch she sees her own<br />
And knows her own, seeing her own alone,<br />
Peering unseen as breath is in June nights.<br />
Surely such dainties rilled no cow-slow eyes;<br />
But Nan and I mean watching and have bid<br />
Maudlin at Grassgarth, Lib at Appletoft<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Under our breath, and hither they steal this eve.<br />
We knew we must not tell you ere the hour,<br />
Or ... or ... too many hinds might creep to be<br />
Their own drowsed leering loutish prophecies.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
Am I so old or wistful to be ringed<br />
That I must feign to be content with one?<br />
Where is this moon-swayed peeping, then, to be,<br />
This blest eavesdropping on a mood of fate?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nan.</span><br />
Here in the barn, where we may crouch un-thought-of<br />
By moon-estranged eyes in gradual darkness.<br />
And lest we startle at o'er-expected footfalls<br />
Or with night-carried voices rouse the farm,<br />
Maudlin and Lib will warn us by dove-cooings&mdash;<br />
Sometimes I hear a cooing up warm nights<br />
From dove pairs far too wise to be asleep,<br />
But mistress bides awake for no such music.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
Dove-cooing Lib will be a thing to brood on&mdash;<br />
I'll miss nought here, although you count me least.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nan.</span><br />
All works with us; for at the forenoon drinking<br />
I heard dame Stir-Wench mutter "These kesh-pithed lasses<br />
Shall sleep no longer three-a-bed beneath<br />
The dark damp closeness of the garret thatch,<br />
That nigh their heads leans low upon the floor,<br />
Until this heat is past; or they will grow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Yet more slob-cheeked and sodden and dough-limbed<br />
I never saw maids look more like green sickness."<br />
And then she bade Giles carry our gear and bedding<br />
Into the empty meal-webbed granary.<br />
Nought could have fallen better; now we have<br />
No moaning ladder's and open doors' groped passing,<br />
No stocking feet need pad the dairy flags;<br />
Only a silverly weathered latchless board<br />
Keeps out the bats that flap toward pale shapes,<br />
And waits to let us into the large night<br />
Throughout the holiest of the mothering year.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
She said green sickness but she meant green apples.<br />
The codlin tree that o'er each moonset stretches<br />
A creeping spider-shadow on the gable<br />
Fills out its fruit weeks earlier this year,<br />
And the one bough with apples onion-roped<br />
Is one the mended ladder will not reach;<br />
It is weight-arched against our garret window,<br />
So that the curled leaves finger on the panes<br />
When midnight winds are sturdy enough to lift it;<br />
Mam Pantry knows and fears bare orchard-shelves<br />
And herds us to an outhouse. Girls, those apples<br />
Will all be basketed before their time,<br />
Ere threshing heaps the granary once more<br />
And sharp nights make her yield our loft again<br />
Because she finds us cuddled on its threshold.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ursel.</span><br />
Mam Patch-Waist counts more eggs than four&mdash;she knows<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Spring wenches' whifts let loose to sniff the night;<br />
So straightway to the granary Mease she sped<br />
To oil the lock and drive a staple in.<br />
Small is our chance of watching now....<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nan.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Quick-Pattens</span><br />
Even ere she rounded must have been a likely,<br />
A very likely maid for her to know<br />
Our scapemell moods howe'er we prim our mouths.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
Mease for two kisses left the staple loose.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ursel</span>, <i>laughing with</i> <span class="smcap">Nan</span>.<br />
Ay, Bet's the market woman, to be sure.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
Mouths, even as eyes, were made to earn our wills.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nan.</span><br />
But how came Bet near Mease up in the corn-spot?<br />
And if she knows the need o' the staple loose<br />
Why will she care to watch with us to-night?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
To learn which one it is, Nanikin sly.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nan.</span><br />
Had it been Mease he'd not have chaffered kisses....<br />
You know more now than you will learn to-night,<br />
You will wed more than all we see to-night&mdash;<br />
We shall win nought beyond a secret spice<br />
Of unclipt gossip in a tasty hour....<br />

Be neither meek nor eager in your toil,<br />
Or Mother Dish-Clout in our gust will read<br />
Some deed afoot; we'll wrangle sluggishly<br />
Until she drives us off to bed unwashed.<br />

Sink down the out-stair as she dips the key<br />
Down the long pocket of her petticoat,<br />
Do nought but cast your shoes&mdash;there's but one wall<br />
Between her chamber and the granary&mdash;<br />
Lie dim along the bed, and never whisper;<br />
But, when we hear her bed-stocks creak and know<br />

There 's no one here&mdash;I wish they might forget<br />

I need much loneliness wherein to suckle<br />
The sadness that alone can bring content:<br />
I am too burdened by long laughing days,<br />

Of the worn earth, the comfort-smelling earth,<br />
Where unexpected trees rose wearily<br />

The pink would fain be white, and the spent white<br />
Still fog and sink to the moon and make an end.<br />

When Gib at Hornbeam-Shallows lost his wife<br />
He had to hire a wench for the first time<br />
And at next Martimas hiring came to me<br />
And offered me four pounds for the half year,<br />
Saying he'd give me his wife's milking coats<br />
To make it up, ay, and her two best shawls,<br />
One darned across the neck-place, one loom-new;<br />
I told him I would liefer have her shoes&mdash;<br />
That frightened him so well he stammered off.<br />
But Sib had heard; she drew him with her eyes,<br />
And said she'd go for three pounds and the shawls<br />
If he would let her use a gown sometimes.<br />
Then at each hiring she stayed on for less,<br />
Till in the third year's end he wedded her;<br />
And so she's gotten shawls and shoes as well.<br />
I missed a savoury chance, for he is old<br />
And childless; both stock and land are his:<br />
Ay, if I had gone quietly to him<br />
Ere now I might have had him for myself.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bet.</span><br />
I should not wait three years for any man....<br />
When Sib would hire a lass Gib said his other<br />
Had done without for seven and thirty years,<br />
And he had ringed her but to save her wage:<br />
At first he sent the hind to milk for her,<br />
But stopped him soon, saying that men's hands<br />
Made cow-teats horny; then at Whitsun hiring<br />
He let him go, grutching it was waste<br />
With such a goodly woman in the yard;<br />
So now she has to herd and fork and winnow,<br />

Gib says young wives are better worth their fodder<br />

Nan must surely see more than that to-night.<br />

Ah, but Sib knows him: he does so fondle her;<br />
He lets her hair down every eve to spread it<br />
And feel the pleasure of the comb's sleek goings,<br />
Bidding her "Stand over" as when a cow<br />
Rubs up against the boust at milking-time;<br />
While, when they gleaned their harvest fields by moonlight<br />
To stint the widows, he would bend down as she<br />
Bobbed up a mouth all blackberry-stains to kiss ...<br />

<span class="smcap">Nan.</span><br />
The consciousness of death.... Though that be all,<br />
It is too much: even if this fetch abides<br />
Unnumbered years ere I see it depart,<br />
Yet all is made unsure and I may sink<br />
Before I have felt half I need to feel.<br />
I must make every passion in myself,<br />
Have each emotion of my wilful sowing&mdash;<br />
The pain of sap, the pain of bud and bloom,<br />
Of hard green fruit sun-bruised to thick gold juice,<br />
The pain of the sharp kernel in the pulp<br />
(Transmuter of sweet to inmost bitterness),<br />
The pain of orderly corruption too&mdash;<br />
Of the withdrawing sap, of the sick falling<br />
Into long grass beneath the rain-soaked boughs,<br />
Of gentle decomposing for small roots;<br />
So that if death's the end, the true completion,<br />
I could believe myself fulfilled and ripe,<br />
A sufferer of the topmost joy and grief,<br />
And past the need of any eternity ...<br />
O, I desire old age, because old age<br />
Has more capacity, more ways of joy....<br />

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Antiochus Theos, one of the Hellenic Kings of the East
of the line of Seleucus, reigned in Antioch. He had espoused
Laodice his kinswoman, according to the usage of his race;
but after many years he put her from him, and took to wife
Berenice, daughter and sister of Ptolemys of Egypt, for
reasons of state.</p>

<p>Laodice withdrew to Ephesus and kept court there: long
affection, resurgent, sent Antiochus thither to join her.
Shortly afterward he died at Ephesus in Laodice's care.</p>

<p>Berenice and Laodice then warred, each to gain the
kingdom for her child: the infant son of Berenice disappeared,
and eventually Seleucus II., the son of Laodice,
held the throne of Antiochus.</p>

<p>In the course of their wars Laodice retired from Ephesus
on finding that Sophron, the governor of the city, secretly
trafficked with the party of Berenice. While she sat in
some adjacent city Sophron unsuspiciously rejoined her
counsels; she immediately devised his death, but he, being
warned by his old love Dana&euml;, the queen's favourite, saved
himself by flight.</p></div>

high in the opposed wall is a short arcade with

Ah, well ... I am tired, and it is your dear turn<br />
To open your arms. Hold me and I will nestle,<br />
Will murmur for you to hear along your neck.<br />
What shall we do to-morrow, Dana&euml;?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Fair mistress, I can dance for you to-morrow.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
Yes, but my dainty cannot dance all day&mdash;<br />
She must have long, long quiet for her thoughts.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Then shall I wing the bright and silken birds<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>About the border of your Persian mantle?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
How should I do without you so many hours?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Your Parthian has a witch of snakes for you&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
I can charm snakes and even pith their fangs.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
This is a rare one and, if she is drunken,<br />
Does uncouth things delicious to the senses.<br />
Steep in her wine the herb that makes insane&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
The herb....?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The viscous plant that grows i' your chamber:</span><br />
Strange longer serpents shall be swiftly snared<br />
And mixt untamed with hers, for you to read<br />
Her gaping and ridiculous tragedy<br />
As the cold perils sober her to pallor.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
It is not novel: with a secret call<br />
I have turned snakes upon such things before.<br />
I am learned and I need some graver pang&mdash;<br />
Something as unsuspected as to tell you<br />
That I had poisoned you three hours ago,<br />
And see you disbelieve&mdash;begin to believe.<br />

If I had done so I should here avouch<br />
I could not do it&mdash;then await a sign.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Ah, I am yours.... You have not doomed me yet.<br />
Queen with the wells of night for human eyes,<br />
Let us descend upon the sea to-morrow,<br />
Rule your own kingdom by your cedarn barge:<br />
We will recline together, hushed as here&mdash;<br />
Save for the waters' converse just beneath,<br />
Permeant as my pulse veiled by your cheek.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
I am uneasy now and should disturb you&mdash;<br />
And thence your restlessness would chafe me more.<br />
I must make sure that you will lie quite still:<br />
May I so still you? Then you shall to sea.<br />
We'll sail about the limit of the lands<br />
Until you reach the river of Babylon.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
So much in one rapt day?<br />
The days of life can never compass that.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
Not in a day, but in a day and night:<br />
Conceive the night, my Dana&euml;, the night&mdash;<br />
It is the natural state of being and space,<br />
Briefly interrupted by casual suns.<br />
Much unknown empires are attained in night&mdash;<br />
Perhaps not Babylon, yet far enough.<br />

You mean that I am poisoned after all.<br />

<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
Indeed, my Dana&euml;, it is not so.<br />
In this barbaric land, this bright harsh dye-pot,<br />
Peopled by camels and cynocephali<br />
And hairy men of soiled uncertain hue,<br />
O, do you not remember nights of Athens<br />
Built well about with marbles and clear skies,<br />
Wherein your mother and such noble women<br />
Conversed with poets and heroes in lit groves,<br />
And life subtled? Have you not longed for them?<br />
I am sending you to such a farther country,<br />
Away from this shrunk mummy of live earth.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Madam, I know you not&mdash;when must I leave you?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice</span>, <i>clapping her hands.</i><br />

Get to your knees about us&mdash;both knees.<br />
Stand up, my Dana&euml;, be overbearing.<br />
Women, when any woman has a kingdom<br />
And is a regnant being, does it not suit<br />
That in the disposition of her state<br />
Women should figure her and power afar?<br />
This kingdom I control has thrones of cities,<br />
So many that I, when I would sit therein,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Must cast my shadow there: and chief of these<br />
Is Babylon the nest of bygone things.<br />
'Tis to that Babylon I now appoint<br />
My bosom's clasp, my Dana&euml;, for satrap;<br />
She shall oppress among dead queens and gods,<br />
Keep house where sheer dominion walks, command<br />
Enamelled palaces with copper roofs,<br />
Pillars with gardens for their pediments&mdash;<br />
Staircase for Anakim in Babylon:<br />
And when ye are as dear to me as she<br />
Ye shall advance upon such larger ways.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
O, what is this you do? I am lost in it.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">A Woman.</span><br />
But how? The duplicate queen holds Babylon.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
It shall be mine again ere Dana&euml;'s advent....<br />
Dana&euml;, sister of pearls, do I displease you?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Dana&euml;.</span><br />
Tell out your purpose, though I wreck by it.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Laodice.</span><br />
Could higher estate persuade such disbelief?<br />
Barsine, now disburden of its store<br />
The old brass coffer in my inner house&mdash;<br />
The gems, the flower-striped silks, the mousse-lines<br />
Worn by such royal girls of Babylon;<br />
So rare a satrap as we do devise<br />
Must be as Babylonish as her earth.<br />

V. Jackson.</p>

<p>Production by Mr. John Drinkwater.</p>

<p>In the course of the production the song of the
Elder Woman, toward the close of the play, was fitted
with so appropriate a melody, by a fortunate modification
of a folk-tune, that it seems well to continue
the connexion by printing the arrangement here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>This represents the extension of the melody used
for the final stanza of the song: it can be adapted to
the forms of the first and second stanzas by the omission
of the sections A-C and B-C respectively. The
Coda is intended for use with the final stanza only.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie (Lecturer in Poetry at the
University of Liverpool) in <i>The Liverpool Daily
Post and Mercury</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This volume has been long overdue. It was the great good
fortune of "Georgian Poetry" that it was permitted to give
this remarkable tragedy of "King Lear's Wife" to the world,
and thus to have the privilege of pioneering Mr. Bottomley's
reputation among those who are unable to do much experimental
reading. It was obviously not only a dramatic poem
but an actable play; so actable, indeed, that it had the extraordinary
fortune of being acted; and what was perhaps even
more remarkable of a poetic play nowadays, it showed itself
capable of being acted precisely and entirely as it had been
written, the technique of the poet contriving to be, with a
completeness not to be paralleled anywhere to-day except in
Italy, simultaneously the technique of the playwright.</p>

<p>The other plays contained in this volume are still to be staged.
They would certainly be not less effective than "King Lear's
Wife" ... the cunning elaboration of supernaturalism in "The
Crier by Night" and "The Riding to Lithend," its combination
in the former with the elemental humanities, in the latter with
vivid character and strangely heroic passion; the deft lucidity of
"Laodice and Dana&euml;," which might serve as a type of dramatic
suspense passing at the exact moment into inevitable catastrophe:
these things, one would think, should be eminently
practical politics for the theatre. If any manager wants plays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in which exciting action is at the same time profound significance,
here they are.</p>

<p>However, we are only able to speculate on this aspect of
Mr. Bottomley's work. But we can console ourselves by simply
reading the plays as poetry.... In the days when theurgy was
still an honourable profession, Apollonius of Tyana said
"Knowing what people say is nothing; I know what people
don't say." That might be put as motto for such poetry as
Mr. Bottomley writes. It is the art of exhibiting realities.
What people don't say is what they really are; and they don't
say it because they can't get hold of it. But he can, and he can
make them say it ... they speak and act as unconstrainedly
as the folk of the everyday world; yet every word and every
gesture is a flashing revelation of spiritual destiny. And not only
men and women, but nature also: tarns and mountains, winds
and the night, trees and stars&mdash;of these, too, Mr. Bottomley
"knows what they don't say."</p>

<p>To the technical beauty of Mr. Bottomley's poetry I have not
alluded. It is extraordinary; but, as in all great poetry, it is
no more than the sign that the reality of things is being
successfully exhibited.</p></div>


<p>Mr. John Drinkwater in "The Nature of Drama"
("Prose Papers": London, Elkin Mathews, 1917,
p. 220).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do say that the capital power of the commercialised theatre
in England to-day is so great that it has been able to impose
its standard on nearly all the people who are habitually in contact
with its merchandise ... so that one piece of catchpenny
insincerity after another is extolled by what passes for expert
opinion as a valuable contribution to the great art of the
dramatist, while a piece of work like Mr. Gordon Bottomley's
"King Lear's Wife," which ... is for vigour of imagination,
poetic eagerness, and dramatic passion not to be excelled by
anything that has been put on to the English stage since the
Elizabethans, is met with a clamour of ignorance ... in most
cases (1915-16) we find no standard whatever being brought to
the judgment of an original work of art other than a spurious
morality.</p></div>


<p>Solomon Eagle in <i>The Outlook</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The various societies which desire to regenerate the theatre
talk a good deal about the poetic drama of the future, but
they do not seem to take much trouble to find it.... Of
Mr. Gordon Bottomley's fine plays only one, to the best of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
knowledge, has yet been produced in this country.... There
is certainly the possibility of a great play in their author, and
one at least of them is better than any play in verse which has
been staged for many years, and is likely to live longer than
most of the so-called masterpieces of our time. If "Midsummer
Eve" had been by Claudel, or "The Riding to Lithend" by
some German (a most unlikely supposition) all the coteries
would have been talking about them years ago....</p>

<p>"Midsummer Eve" is original, and the work of a poet....
There is fine meditative poetry in it, poetry, moreover, not
grafted or glued on to its main structure, but growing out of
the dialogue naturally, in an inevitable manner.... "Laodice
and Dana&euml;" is equally good reading, and it is dramatic. But
none of these plays is equal to the two latest, "The Riding to
Lithend" and "King Lear's Wife."...</p>

<p>Enough has been written about the grimness of "King Lear's
Wife," the fine bursts of poetry in it, and the remarkable
character of Goneril.... "The Riding to Lithend" is, up to
the present, the best of Mr. Bottomley's plays; and its superiority
is a superiority which, I think, would be still more evident
on the stage than it is in print.... It comes straight out of an
old tale; the characters are recreated and enriched.... The
diction is, as a rule, perfect in its propriety and often striking in
its beauty. And, above all, Gunnar is a hero, his fight a heroic
fight, his courage, his generosity, his humanity (a few sentences
to wife and hound are wonderfully chosen), and even his
weaknesses are such as to move the heart. His fall is like the
fall of all noble and fighting things; the sense of defeat comes
with it, but above that a feeling of exultation. On the stage the
end, I fancy, would be profoundly moving, and the fight exciting
to a degree, though there is no obvious rhodomontade
about it.</p></div>


<p>Mr. John Freeman in <i>The Bookman</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This comely volume at last makes public what has been too
long a fugitive and cloistered pleasure.... These five plays
show the author in the most powerful exercise of his faculties.
Imagination here is free and moves with growing ease, music
enlarges like a splendid wind through the verse; and the
common reproach of mere "poetic plays" has been avoided in
these, where character and action develope as surely as music
itself. Gordon Bottomley has remembered that his plays can
have no life except in the activity of his characters.... Fine
careless raptures alone will not produce a play like "The
Riding to Lithend" ... you may quote almost any lines from
this fierce Icelandic play and find that what you are reading is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
vital and essential to the expression of character and action.
And in this poetry, too ... the beautiful images flow in and
out with the ease of light on water; the rhythms have the
natural movement of thought, and the secret discipline of
masculine habit. "King Lear's Wife" will be familiar to many
readers, but to others it will come with the delicious shock of
a new creation.... The new play is a beam of light crossing
the darkness of the old. Few passages of modern verse reach
the beauty of Goneril's hunting-narration; and it is no isolated
beauty.</p></div>


<p>Mr. William Rose Ben&egrave;t in The Literary Review of
the <i>New York Evening Post</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Crier by Night" is one of the most powerful and eerie
poetic dramas of the supernatural that have been written in
the last two decades. To me the best-known translations of
Maeterlinck pale beside it.... I hold "The Riding to Lithend"
his greatest achievement. To me it is like a piece of gorgeous
tapestry blurred by wood-smoke and sea-mist and hung on a
granite wall. The dramatic structure is knit as compact as a
rock. Across the shimmering imagery of the diction blows a
chill and foreboding wind of the spirit.... The verse is nobly
distinguished. "King Lear's Wife" is also a notable piece of
work.... It possesses convincing reality.... Again the
dramatic structure satisfies completely. "Midsummer Eve" is
packed with fragrant beauty ... that creeps around the
heart.... The atmosphere is the important thing about this
play and is unforgettable. "Laodice and Dana&euml;" is more usual
(for Bottomley, for very few other writers), but it is the
work of a sure dramatic craftsman with an enthralling tale to
tell.... There is a splendid artistic austerity about his work
... yet mixed with this there is an entirely full-blooded love
of the earth, a delight in intensely human detail.... He has
indeed displayed many gifts imperishably bright. His name
should stand high in the roster of modern English verse.</p></div>


<p><i>The Morning Post.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rare beauty and distinction of these works have been ungrudgingly
acclaimed by many critics, but they have hitherto
lacked that wider recognition for which they are indubitably
destined.... But now the bringing of them together in
one volume permits us all to appraise the quality of what is the
most significant accomplishment of our Georgians. It is impossible
to be impervious to the strength and beauty, knit together,
of these dramas.... Criticism may note with admiration the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
unerring skill of dramatic structure; with delight the mastery
of language, which constrains the simplest words to the greatest
needs; with wonder the reading of the human heart.... The
man who can handle character and emotion with such mastery
both of language and imagination is indeed a poet....
In Mr. Bottomley the Georgian era has found an authentic
voice&mdash;a veritable interpreter.</p></div>


<p><i>The Times Literary Supplement.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We must honour the devoted writers who keep alive the
desire for the poetic drama, and none more than Mr. Gordon
Bottomley.... He is a poet and justifies his use of poetic
speech; he is eloquent, incisive, has a blank verse of his own
which he writes with increasing mastery.... In "The Riding
to Lithend" he rises with his story ... the death of Gunnar
is well done; you read it breathlessly, for he makes it the death
of Gunnar indeed; and even the slayers feel the greatness of
it. Mr. Bottomley, in a more fortunate age, might, we think,
have been a dramatic poet like Fletcher; he has Fletcher's
eloquence though not his fun,... but not, of course, Fletcher's
familiarity with the stage.... If he had been bred in the
theatre, he might, we think, have had Fletcher's real and
delightful success.</p></div>


<p><i>John O' London's Weekly.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The cumulative effect of a re-reading of Mr. Bottomley's
work is to convince one that he is a real poet who can write
real drama. In the matter of construction these plays approach
perfection; the building up is masterly, and the verse is full of
variety and imagination.... The finest as drama is "King
Lear's Wife," though for sheer beauty and spiritual significance
I should be inclined to place "Midsummer Eve" first. Only
one of these plays has been acted in England. If we had a live
stage they would all be acted.</p></div>


<p><i>The New Statesman.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Gordon Bottomley's plays are good art. There are
moments in "King Lear's Wife" when he approaches greatness....
It contains passages of very rare force, and the
dramatic power ... is of a very high quality. In this play
and in "The Crier by Night" he recalls to us not the late
Elizabethans so much as that strange uneasy genius Thomas
Lovell Beddoes.... He is a purer poet, dramatically, than
was Beddoes, and his song has a clearer richer quality, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
imaginative, though not quite so fantastic; but he resembles
Beddoes in his stern saddened preoccupations with the passing
of mortals. Few plays have a greater unity of atmosphere or
a more boding one than has "The Riding to Lithend." In all
the plays, however, one finds a real poet who is also a real
dramatist; there is little of decoration in any of the plays, and
nothing of that windy seasonal rhetoric which is so common in
some poetic plays.</p></div>


<p>I. B. in <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is an excellent thing that these plays, the earliest of which
was published twenty years ago, should have been brought
together and given a new lease of public life.... It is indeed
quite extraordinary that, with so much publishing of poetry
during the last few years, work of such high distinction should
have remained under cover. Mr. Gordon Bottomley's art of
tragedy, as well as his craftsmanship in verse, can be seen
ripening through this series until it comes to a rich maturity in
"King Lear's Wife." Here ... austerity and compassion are
compounded, and so create the tragic atmosphere in which
small words are big with infinite meaning and hints develope
the power of hammer-blows.... It is the best of the group,
and it is significant, as showing the inherent union between
matter and form, that when the poet writes his best play he
also writes his best verse.... He is admirably master of
himself and of his medium.</p></div>


<p><i>The Spectator.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Neither in the setting of the scene of "King Lear's Wife,"
the conduct of the story, or its embellishment and illustration,
is there a wasted word.... But amid the abundance of this
most rich, most ample of little plays, there is surely nothing&mdash;nothing,
we mean, that can be detached from its setting&mdash;that
surpasses Goneril's two speeches to her mother.... Whether
Mr. Gordon Bottomley&mdash;though calling his creations by their
Shakespearean names in his heart&mdash;would not have done better
to call his monarch Cole or Cadwallader in print is a question
with which controversy will probably long be busy. It is a play
which would not be spoiled if, in a pet, he had called the protagonists
Smith, Jones, and Robinson. We recommend this
test, by the way, to those who are called upon to pronounce
judgment upon the poetic drama. There is more in it than
meets the eye.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The London Mercury.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is some years since the public was surprised to learn that
Mr. Gordon Bottomley had written a prelude to "King Lear,"
which not only offered some solution of the problems of that
work, but was also in itself a play of considerable beauty,
originality, and power. This piece now serves for the title of a
volume of collected plays.... It was effective and moving on
the stage, and it makes its effect, though perhaps a different
one, when it is read in the study.... An extract will serve to
illustrate the flexible, elastic, and individual versification. We
should do wrong, however, if we were to give the impression
that his plays are only for the study, valuable for such passages,
and lacking in the harder bones of dramatic merit. The action
is not an excuse for decorative poetry, but is the immediate and
all-important thing.... These are the creations of a dramatist
who has no need of descriptive decoration to conceal the weakness
of his prime conceptions.</p></div>


<p><i>The Nation.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The wave of poetic drama has now ebbed, and this form is
practised very little to-day, lyrical and experimental verse
having almost entirely supplanted it. Mr. Bottomley's plays
are the only ones which, with the going-out of the tide, have
managed to escape its "long withdrawing roar" and retain a
place on the shore.... Without any doubt they express a
singular power of mysterious evocation.... They are not at
all vague and inchoate&mdash;on the contrary, these towering
shadows are remarkably and firmly differentiated.... We find
"The Crier by Night" and "The Riding to Lithend"&mdash;especially
the former&mdash;the most darkly and magically impressive of
all the plays.... An image in the former positively makes
you jump as Donne makes you jump with his imagery....
But perhaps his most striking achievement is the way he can
make these shapes of an intensely brooding ... imagination
speak out in taut, muscular, even gruffly vivid language. He
has avoided, and very properly avoided, the tenuous chantings,
effeminate imagery, and listless monochrome of the Celtic drama.
Mr. Bottomley's plays, in fact, are peculiar and esoteric, but
they undoubtedly achieve a strong success in their own
character.</p></div>


<p><i>The Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Gordon Bottomley is one of the few writers of poetical
plays whom it is necessary to take very seriously: his blemishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
are minor and few in number; his poetical qualities very much
outweigh his defects. He is at his best in expressing subtle
states of mind, and in formulating generalizations. His real
distinction lies in his dramatic power. His characters have
solidity and life ... they are not mere symbols, but human
beings. His plays are marked by the economy of construction
of stage plays. It is significant to note that Mr. Bottomley's
pieces are excellent in proportion as they are actable.</p></div>


<p><i>The Saturday Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of their kind, Mr. Bottomley's plays are remarkably good.
They have atmosphere and action; they are exquisitely
wrought; they are moving and dramatic. They will surely be
among the most delightful discoveries of future generations;
and if by the beginning of the twenty-first century our successors
have contrived to establish a national or folk theatre, it is fairly
safe to prophesy that three at least of them will find a place in
its repertory.</p></div>


<p><i>The Observer.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Since the issue of "The Crier by Night" in 1902, Mr. Bottomley
has worked with a sincerity and devotion which are more
commendable than the more frequent essays of less conscientious
artists. We remember one considerable and beautifully produced
book of miscellaneous verse, "The Gate of Smaragdus,"
and there have been other plays issued semi-privately, until the
publication of "King Lear's Wife" gave him a wider public,
and reminded younger readers of his very definite and dignified
talent.... If as a <i>tour de force</i>, the latter is the greatest, we
still prefer, for sheer poetic beauty, for propriety of phrase and
for directness of action, the earlier "Riding to Lithend." Hallgerd
is an exceptionally fine creation, and she is given to speak
passages of rare force and beauty. This play, too, has a fierce
dramatic quality.</p></div>

<p>Mr. R. Ellis Roberts in <i>The Daily News</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Bottomley's plays have all one merit without which
poetical drama is a thing indefensible. There is always in them
a definite note of necessity.... Not only does Mr. Bottomley
choose subjects which make his decision to write in verse seem
natural and right, he writes blank verse of a dignity and worth
which responds at once to the needs of natural, and the convention
of poetic, speech. His poetry is in the full English
tradition; he enjoys his vocabulary with that careful, inventive
joy which is the privilege of all who are sensitive to the individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
word. He can use rhetoric; but he rarely allows himself to be
drawn away into mere hectic luxury of language. The best of
his plays is, I think, "The Riding to Lithend," a rendering of
the old life of Iceland, which really represents for us the
passionate, hasty life of the old Sagas, while it is free from
the pedantry which spoils so many efforts to reproduce Scandinavian
heroics. Hallgerd is a genuine piece of dramatic
creation. "Midsummer Eve," with its quiet, wind-blown pathos,
is equally notable; and the quality of its verse shows Mr.
Bottomley's talent at its highest and simplest.</p></div>

<p><i>The Actor.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In these plays, the public is reminded of Mr. Gordon Bottomley's
almost unique power, as among his contemporaries, of
presenting the sinister, the grim, the tragic, or the merely
weird, in a poetic garment of power and beauty ... in dramatic
force and verse charm.</p></div>

<p><i>The Journal of Commerce</i>, Chicago, U.S.A.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These plays are put into a format and style of book that
honour the contents, and when you know the contents of this
remarkable dramatic poetry that is praise indeed. They hold
you strangely.... The dialogue is skilfully modulated, it is a
veritable song-speech, illuminated by luminous pauses, by the
speaking silences that can invest, if rightly used, the static with
so much more dramatic feeling than the more obviously
emotional action. The plays are impressive even in the reading
of them, then how much more effective they would be if acted
and declaimed&mdash;but in a manner worthy of their high art.</p></div>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
